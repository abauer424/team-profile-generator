# My Awesome Team

## Description 

For this assignment, our task was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes information about a team and compiles it into an html page that has information for each person. It was also required to do various steps throughout the coding process to make sure everything works and all of the tests pass.

For My Awesome Team, I used Jest for running tests and Inquirer for collecting the input form the user. I made a folder directory that was easy to navigate through and store coded files.

## Installation

To install the project, you need to use git clone and git pull from <a href ="https://github.com/abauer424/team-profile-generator">my repository.</a> After cloning its important to install Node, Jest & Inquirer.  


## Usage 

When opening the repository, first the user will ensure all tests pass. To do this, the user will navigate into the __tests__ folder and open each test, starting with Employee.test.js. Once this is opened as shown below, the user will open a new terminal, type cd __tests__ to ensure they are in the correct folder and then type npm run test. They should see the image below will all passing tests:

Next the user will answer the questions and see the html page be generated. To do this, the user will navigate over to the index.js file and open a new terminal. In the terminal be sure you are in the parent folder and type node index.js. The user will then be prompted with a list of questions to answer as the image shows below:

Lastly the user will see based on the data they answered in the questions, it will populate an HTML page as seen below:
